1) You have to create 2 folder (music, img). { Remember:- You have to use Exact name }
2) You have to rename the songs name into (music1,music2,music3,...like this or song1, song2, song3...) & place all the songs into the (music) folder.
3) Also rename the images name into (img1,img2,img3,...like this or thumb1, thumb2, thumb3...) & place all the images into the (image) folder.
